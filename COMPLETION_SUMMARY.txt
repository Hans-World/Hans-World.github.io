THE THREE-LAYER ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

LAYER 1: MOTION & BEHAVIOR (JavaScript)
File: /scripts/script.js
Owner: Frontend Developer
Content: Animations, interactions, user behavior
Does: Smooth scrolling, form validation, event handling
Avoids: Setting colors, modifying layout, hardcoding hex values

LAYER 2: LAYOUT & STRUCTURE (HTML + CSS)
Files: /index.html, /styles/layout.css (future)
Owner: Layout person + Content Manager
Content: Structure, spacing, typography, responsive design
Does: Flexbox, grid, padding, margins, media queries
Avoids: Color values, JavaScript logic, animation timing

LAYER 3: COLORS & APPEARANCE (CSS)
File: /styles/style.css
Owner: UI/UX Designer
Content: Color palettes, visual appearance, theming
Does: Color variables, backgrounds, shadows, contrast
Avoids: Layout properties, typography scale, responsive logic

IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
================================================================================

WEEK 1 (This Week): Understand & Plan
- Coordinator: Read all documentation
- Designer: Understand color-only responsibility
- Developer: Understand motion-only responsibility
- Content Manager: Understand text-only responsibility
- All: Team sync to align on architecture

WEEK 2: Design Phase
- Designer: Create Apple-inspired color palette
- Developer: Continue building JavaScript features
- Coordinator: Plan CSS refactoring (layout.css separation)
- QA: Prepare testing checklist

WEEK 3: Integration & Refactoring
- Developer: Apply new colors to style.css
- Refactor: Separate layout.css from style.css
- Developer: Complete JavaScript interactivity
- QA: Begin comprehensive testing

WEEK 4: Final Polish
- QA: Full cross-device testing
- All: Final review and optimizations
- Deploy: Ready for launch

================================================================================
GOLDEN RULES FOR YOUR TEAM
================================================================================

1. ONE AGENT, ONE LAYER
   Designer owns colors only
   Developer owns motion/interaction only
   Layout person owns spacing/structure only

2. USE CSS VARIABLES
   Never hardcode colors in HTML or JavaScript
   Always use: color: var(--color-primary);

3. USE CLASSES FOR BEHAVIOR
   Don't set inline styles in JavaScript
   Use: element.classList.add('state-name');
   CSS handles the colors and styling

4. LOAD LAYOUT FIRST, COLORS SECOND
   HTML load order matters:
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="layout.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

5. NO COLOR LOGIC IN JAVASCRIPT
   Colors are CSS variables, not JavaScript
   JS triggers classes, CSS applies colors

================================================================================
CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

You'll know the architecture is working when:

✓ Designer can add new color without touching layout
✓ Developer can add animation without setting colors
✓ CSS files have clear, single purposes
✓ Team communication is clear about responsibilities
✓ Code is maintainable and easy to understand
✓ No rework needed due to scope creep

✓ New features added smoothly with clear ownership

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. TODAY:
   → Read: README_ARCHITECTURE.md
   → Read: ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
   → Share documents with your team

2. THIS WEEK:
   → Each agent reads their role-specific documentation
   → Team sync meeting to discuss questions
   → Designer begins color palette work
   → Developer continues JavaScript features

3. NEXT WEEK:
   → Review CSS refactoring decision
   → Begin applying designer's color palette
   → Plan separation of layout.css

4. GOING FORWARD:
   → Use THREE_LAYER_CHEAT_SHEET.md for quick reference
   → Reference ARCHITECTURE.md for deep questions
   → Use ARCHITECTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for coordination

================================================================================
KEY CONCEPTS EXPLAINED
================================================================================

APPLE-INSPIRED DESIGN (In This Architecture)
Means: Premium color palette, high contrast, semantic colors, subtle effects
Does NOT mean: Changing layout, spacing, typography scale

YOUR DESIGNERS FOCUS ON: Color choices and visual appearance
NOT on: Layout decisions, which are already Apple-like

WHY SEPARATION?
Colors change frequently → Own their own file (easy theme swapping)
Layout is set once → Stable, rarely modified
Motion added gradually → Can be added independently

HANDOFF PROTOCOL:
Designer completes color palette → Developer applies colors → QA tests both
No skipping steps, no overlap, clear deliverables

================================================================================

- Resolve questions and conflicts
- Maintain consistency as the project scales

All documentation is:
- Comprehensive (but not overwhelming)
